{"name":"Erik van Kempen on GitHub","tagline":"","body":"![Inclino Logo](http://inclino.nl/logo.png \"Inclino\")\r\n\r\n### Erik van Kempen\r\n\r\nI am a lecturer in Statistics, ERP and Business Intelligence at Fontys Univerity of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Prior to my lectureship, I obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration in\r\nAccountancy. My research interests are in the areas continuous assurance, smart auditing, business intelligence and process mining.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am working on a custom package in R: continuityequations.\r\n\r\n### Inclino ###\r\nInclino develops custom software solutions for the accounting  sector in the continuous assurance domain, i.e. automated testing of controls and data integrity, are developed. The organisation focuses on efficiency and effectiveness of testing by automating conventionally manual tasks.\r\n\r\n### Continuity Equations\r\nThe [inclino/continuityequations](https://github.com/inclino/continuityequations) project aims to implement a single [R](http://www.r-project.org/ \"The R Project for Statistical Computing\") package for using continuity equations in continuous assurance.\r\n\r\nContinuous assurance is a methodology to provide assurance on financial data on a near real-time basis. One of the fundamental elements of continuous assurance is continuous data auditing  in which the integrity of the data provided by the client is tested. Continuity equations can be used to evidence assertions regarding data integrity. In order to do so, data is tested by predicting subsequent values based on a fitting model.\r\n\r\nThis approach is based on a paper by [Kogan et al. (2010)](http://raw.rutgers.edu/docs/Innovations/Continuity%20Equations.pdf) in which several models are tested.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
